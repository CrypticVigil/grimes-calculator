      <p>This file contains explanations of how the program works. Last edited on January 5, 2019.</p>

      <h2>Garment &amp; Quantity</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The values for the garment cost dropdown items can be edited in the index.html file (found on the network
          drive at Grimes Graphics > Documents > Forms > Calculator). They are contained in the tag that starts with
          <code>&lt;select id="garment" class="leftSelect widthTwo"&gt;</code> The item price can be changed by editing
          the number between the quotation marks of the value attribute. The option tags look like this:
          <code>&lt;option value="3.40"&gt;Gildan 2000 (cotton t-shirts)&lt;/option&gt;</code> Only change the numbers
          between the quotation marks. I usually round the prices up to the nearest 10 or 20 cents.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also change the item description by typing a new description between the option tags. Like this:
          <code>&lt;option value="3.40"&gt;</code>New Description Here<code>&lt;/option&gt;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Garment Cost input overrides the dropdown select. The checkbox indicates whether markup should be added to
          the garment cost. When the checkbox is deselected, no markup is added.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Exact Quantity input overrides the quantity dropdown. You can also add numbers by putting plus symbols
          between the numbers and pressing enter.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Additional Cost input is just for any extra fee or cost that isn't covered by the other options. It can
          also take negative numbers if you want to offer a discount.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Screen Printing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Exact Scr. input overrides the silkscreens dropdown. This is mainly used for jobs needing partial screens.
          I generally charge half the silkscreens for a left chest imprint. So if a job needs a 5-color left chest
          imprint, I would normally charge for 2.5 silkscreens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Embroidery</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I recommend inputting the number of stitches in thousands. So you can simply put in 7 instead of 7000. It also
          works with exact stitch counts, but just rounds up to the next thousand. Enter 6254 and it will calculate
          based on 7000 stitches.
        </li>
        <li>For custom names, put in 5 for one-line names and 7 for two-line names.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Heat Application</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you just type in a value for the Height, it will still work. It assumes you're using the full roll width.
        </li>
        <li>
          The values for the preset options are contained in the tag that starts with
          <code>&lt;select id="heatPresets" class="leftSelect widthOne"&gt;</code>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you don't choose any options before clicking Calculate, the price will only be for the garment with markup.
        </li>
        <li>The adjustment dropdowns allow you to tweak the output price.</li>
        <li>
          The Est. Print Time only calculates print time. Embroidery or heat-application are not included in the
          calculation.
        </li>
        <li>The Digitize Fee simply multiplies the stitch count times $4.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Info</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          There are a few shortcut keys you can use. Enter or the E key is the same as clicking the calculate button.
          The R key will reload the page so you can start a new price quote.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
