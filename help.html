		<h1>Pricing Calculator Readme</h1>

		<p>This file contains explanations of how the program works. Last edited on June 13, 2018.</p>

		<h2>Garment &amp; Quantity</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The values for the first item dropdown can be edited in the calculator.html file. They are contained in the tag that starts with <code>&lt;select id="garment" class="leftSelect widthTwo"&gt;</code> The item price can be changed by editing the number between the quotation marks of the value attribute. The option tags look like this: <code>&lt;option value="3.00"&gt;Gildan 2000 (cotton t-shirts)&lt;/option&gt;</code></li>
			<li>The Garment Cost input overrides the dropdown select. The checkbox indicates whether markup should be added to the garment cost. When the checkbox is deselected, no markup is added.</li>
			<li>The Exact Quantity input overrides the quantity dropdown.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Screen Printing</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>The Exact Scr. input overrides the silkscreens dropdown. This is mainly used for jobs needing partial screens. If a job needs a 5-color left chest imprint, I would normally charge for 2.5 silkscreens.</li>
			<li>The screen printing pricing doesn't run unless there's a value selected from the 1st Imprint dropdown.</li>
		</ul>		

		<h2>Embroidery</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>I recommend inputting the number of stitches in thousands. So you can simply put in 7 instead of 7000. It also works with exact stitch counts, but just rounds up to the next thousand. Enter 6254 and it will calculate based on 7000 stitches.</li>
			<li>For custom names, put in 5 for one-line names and 7 for two-line names.</li>
			<li>The embroidery pricing doesn't run unless there's a value entered in the Stitches 1st input box.</li>
		</ul>		

		<h2>Heat Application</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>If you just type in a value for the Height, it will still work. It assumes you're using the full roll width.</li>
			<li>The values for the preset options are contained in the tag that starts with <code>&lt;select id="heatPresets" class="leftSelect widthOne"&gt;</code></li>
			<li>The heat application pricing doesn't run unless there's a value selected from the Preset Options dropdown or a value in the Height input.</li>
		</ul>	

		<h2>Price Information</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>If you don't choose any options before clicking Calculate, the price will only be for the garment with markup.</li>
			<li>The adjustment dropdowns allow you to tweak the output price.</li>
			<li>The Est. Print Time only calculates print time. Embroidery or heat-application are not included in the calculation.</li>
			<li>The Digitize Fee simply multiplies the stitch count times $4.</li>
		</ul>
