        <h2>Garment &amp; Quantity</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The values for the garment cost dropdown items can be edited in the index.html file (found on the network
            drive at Grimes Graphics > Documents > Forms > Calculator). They are contained in the tag that starts with
            <code>&lt;select id="garment" class="leftSelect widthTwo"&gt;</code> The item price can be changed by
            editing the number between the quotation marks of the value attribute. The option tags look like this:
            <code>&lt;option value="3.40" data-xxl="2.60"&gt;Gildan 2000 (cotton t-shirts)&lt;/option&gt;</code> Only
            change the numbers between the quotation marks. I usually round the prices up to the nearest 10 or 20 cents.
            To update the 2XL price, change the value in the data-xxl quotation marks.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also change the item description by typing a new description between the option tags. Like this:
            <code>&lt;option value="3.40" data-xxl="2.60"&gt;</code>New Description Here<code>&lt;/option&gt;</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Garment Cost input overrides the dropdown select. The checkbox indicates whether markup should be added
            to the garment cost. When there is not check in the checkbox, no markup is added.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Exact Quantity input overrides the quantity dropdown. You can also use this input to do basic addition.
            If you put in a sequence of numbers with plus symbols in between each number, it will total the numbers when
            you hit calculate (or Enter). For example, if you put in <code>5+9+13+2</code> and press enter it will
            change to 29.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Additional Cost input is just for any extra fee or cost that isn't covered by the other options. It can
            also take negative numbers if you want to offer a discount.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Screen Printing</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The Exact Scr. input overrides the silkscreens dropdown. This is mainly used for jobs needing partial
            screens. I generally charge half the silkscreens for a left chest imprint. So if a job needs a 5-color left
            chest imprint, I would normally charge for 2.5 silkscreens.
          </li>
          <li>
            It doesn't matter which order you put in the imprints. For example, if you put in 2nd and 4th imprints only,
            it will still work fine.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Embroidery</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I recommend inputting the number of stitches in thousands. So you can simply put in 7 instead of 7000. It
            also works with exact stitch counts, but just rounds up to the next thousand. Enter 6254 and it will
            calculate based on 7000 stitches.
          </li>
          <li>For custom names, put in 5 for one-line names and 7 for two-line names.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="wrapper__right">
        <h2>Heat Application</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If you just type in a value for the Height, it will still work. It assumes you're using the full roll width.
          </li>
          <li>
            The values for the preset options are contained in the tag that starts with
            <code>&lt;select id="heatPresets" class="leftSelect widthOne"&gt;</code>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pricing</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If you don't choose any options before clicking Calculate, the price will only be for the garment with
            markup.
          </li>
          <li>
            The adjustment dropdowns allow you to tweak the output price up to $0.40. For example, if you price an item
            that shows it will cost $7.10 per shirt. You could decide to round down the 10 cents and just charge $7.00.
            Then you could price other items and the reduction would still apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you click on "XX or more", it will highlight that row. This can be useful for remembering which amounts
            you are quoting for a specific order.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Est. Print Time only calculates print time. Embroidery or heat-application are not included in the
            calculation.
          </li>
          <li>The Digitize Fee simply multiplies the stitch count times $4.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Info</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            There are a few shortcut keys you can use. Enter or the E key is the same as clicking the calculate button.
            The R key will reload the page so you can start a new price quote.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to make changes to the prices, you'll need to edit the index.html file (see Garment &amp;
            Quantity section for more details). This can be done with Notepad if needed, but it's much easier to use a
            code editor like VS Code, Adobe Dreamweaver, or Notepad++. VS Code and Notepad++ are available for free.
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you make any changes to the code files, make sure to have a backup somewhere in case something
            breaks. Google Drive would be a good option, or just another folder on the network drive.
          </li>
          <li>
            If something does break, make sure to check that all the quotation marks and &gt; or &lt; symbols are in the
            right places. A mistake even that small could break the whole page.
          </li>
